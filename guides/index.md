## Guides

SchemaLink is an open-source project that can be used and modified for non-commercial purposes under its [AGPL license](https://github.com/AnacletoLAB/schemalink-webapp/blob/main/LICENSE).  
We provide two guides to assist our users:  

- **Developer Guide**: A resource for developers to add or update SchemaLink features.  
- **User Guide**: A step-by-step guide for end users.
